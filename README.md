# An X-Wing Second Edition Quick Reference Cards & Sheets

![Quick Reference Card](https://nicholas.piegdon.info/stuff/xwing2-quick-reference.jpg)

While the original single-page quick reference included at the end of the official Rulebook covers most of the simple things (how to get tokens), it leaves off most of the fiddly, interesting bits (how to spend tokens).

This alternative quick reference tries to collect all the most relevant information from the official Rules Reference document, while staying as compact as possible, either on 3 double-sided cards (7" x 6.3" = 18 cm x 16 cm) - or alternatively (as of v10) as 3 letter-sized sheets. 

### Where's the PDF?
Download it from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/npiegdon/xwing2-quick-reference/releases/latest) page.

## New Sections

This supplants the official quick reference by adding the following sections:

- **Tokens**: What they imply and how to spend them.
- **Maneuvers**: Never confuse Segnor's Loop with Tallon Roll again!  Also sorts out the subtle differences between moving through and overlapping various objects.  Includes a diagram showing each.
- **Obstacles**: What it means when you hit one and the differences between them.
- Some front page wording has been updated to clarify a few subtle points.
- **Devices**: A new overview of all bombs, mines, and remotes, and their effects.
- **Scenarios**: A new overview of the standard-play scenarios introduced by AMG with version 2.5.

## Color Dice Font

To add the dice images without breaking up or flowing images around the text, I created a color (emoji) vector font that uses images of the game dice that were Live Traced in illustrator.  `xwing-dice.otf` contains two red and two green dice images, mapped to the characters a, b, c, and d.
