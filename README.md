# An Improved X-Wing Second Edition Quick Reference

![Quick Reference Card](https://nicholas.piegdon.info/stuff/xwing2-quick-reference.jpg)

The single-page quick reference included at the end of the official Rulebook covers most of the simple things (how to get tokens) but left off most of the fiddly, interesting bits (how to spend tokens).

This version adds a second page and is formatted to be printed (and laminated) as a double-sided reference card.

### Where's the PDF?
Download it from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/npiegdon/xwing2-quick-reference/releases/latest) page.

## New Sections

This supplants the official quick reference by adding the following sections:

- **Tokens**: What they imply and how to spend them.
- **Maneuvers**: Never confuse Segnor's Loop with Tallon Roll again!  Also sorts out the subtle differences between moving through and overlapping various objects.
- **Obstacles**: What it means when you hit one and the differences between them.
- Some front page wording has been updated to clarify a few subtle points.

## Color Dice Font

To add the dice images without breaking up or flowing images around the text, I created a color (emoji) vector font that uses images of the game dice that were Live Traced in illustrator.  `xwing-dice.otf` contains two red and two green dice images, mapped to the characters a, b, c, and d.
